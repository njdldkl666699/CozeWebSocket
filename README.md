## Introduction

QuecPython introduces the Coze Platform Websocket  Access solution. This solution is based on the WebSocket protocol, offering cross-platform compatibility and supporting most QuecPython modules.

This demo uses an AI development board equipped with the EC800MCNLE module.

## Features

- Supports voice interruption/barge-in.
- Supports keyword-based voice wake-up.
- Uses Python for easy secondary development.
